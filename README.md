## About Me

Apps & Web development across multiple projects, primarily using .NET C# to create mobile apps with Xamarin Forms/MAUI for Android and iOS, web services, WPF applications, and Windows services. In some applications and web services, I use SQL Server and Entity Framework.

I own software for managing clinical centers, developed with Delphi and Firebird, which also includes modules developed in C# for online payments (bank and PayPal), appointment reservations, and videoconferencing.

Several years ago, I also used Java to develop Android apps and Objective-C for iOS apps.

I have developed websites using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP with MySQL.

I have created various types of software, including: an app for delivery personnel; an app enabling clients to post orders, check their status, and receive notifications; applications serving as user interfaces for industrial machines that communicate with PLCs; and applications for transforming data from input to output, with configurable XML settings for different data sources, conditions, and transformations, among others.

In recent years, I have also managed project development with a small team of developers, translating client requirements into time estimates for budget preparation and then creating the corresponding tasks in Jira.
